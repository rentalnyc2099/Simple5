  4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
</div>

<div class="indent">
  I have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due.
  A payment of Principal only is known as a "Prepayment." When I make a
  Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder in writing that I am doing so. I may
  not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made all the monthly
  payments due under the Note.
</div>

<div class="indent">
  I may make a full Prepayment or partial Prepayments without paying a Prepayment
  charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to reduce the amount of
  Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply my
  Prepayment to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount before
  applying my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a
  partial Prepayment, there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount
  of my monthly payment unless the Note Holder agrees in writing to those
  changes.
</div>

<div style="font-weight:bold; ">
  5. LOAN CHARGES
</div>

<div class="indent">
  If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is
  finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to
  be collected in connection with this loan exceed the permitted limits, then:
  (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the
  charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me which
  exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. The Note Holder may choose to
  make this refund by reducing the Principal I owe under this Note or by making a
  direct payment to me. If a refund reduces Principal, the reduction will be
  treated as a partial Prepayment.
</div>
